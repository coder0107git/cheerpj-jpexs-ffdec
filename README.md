[JPEXS FFDEC](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) (JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler) running online with CheerpJ 4.


## Running

**Note:** The website has an in page version of developer tools ([Eruda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eruda)) to easily inspect the console and network requests. It doesn't log network requests for CheerpJ resources but it does log the FFDEC network requests. Add `#console` to the URL to display.
